<h2>📘 Project Overview</h2>

<p>
Agriculture is the backbone of civilization — but in the modern era, challenges like <strong>unpredictable weather</strong>, 
<strong>soil degradation</strong>, and <strong>pest outbreaks</strong> make sustainable farming more complex than ever.  
This project, <strong>"Optimize Agricultural Production"</strong>, represents my first major step into the world of 
<strong>advanced Python and machine learning</strong> — where I aimed to bring the power of data-driven intelligence to the field.
</p>

<p>
Using <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>Jupyter Notebook</strong>, I explored diverse agricultural datasets to uncover hidden patterns, 
train predictive models, and generate actionable insights for farmers.  
With every iteration, I worked toward one goal — <em>transforming agriculture into a smarter, more sustainable system.</em>

<h2>🧠 Machine Learning Pipeline</h2>

<pre>
# 🌾 Importing Libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error, r2_score

# 🌱 Load and Prepare Data
data = pd.read_csv("agriculture_dataset.csv")
X = data.drop('Crop_Yield', axis=1)
y = data['Crop_Yield']

# 🌤️ Split Data for Training and Testing
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# 🚜 Train the Model
model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=200, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# 📈 Evaluate Performance
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
print("Mean Absolute Error:", mean_absolute_error(y_test, y_pred))
print("R² Score:", r2_score(y_test, y_pred))
